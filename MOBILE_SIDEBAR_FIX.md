# Mobile Sidebar Fix - Employee Portal

## Problem
On mobile devices, the employee dashboard sidebar was completely hidden with no way to access:
- Overview
- Projects  
- Reports
- Time Tracker

The sidebar was only visible on desktop/laptop screens.

## Solution
Added a **hamburger menu button** (☰) in the header that appears only on mobile devices to toggle the sidebar drawer.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Header.tsx** - Added Hamburger Menu Button
**File:** `starterkit/src/app/(EmployeeLayout)/layout/vertical/header/Header.tsx`

**Added:**
- Import for `IconMenu2` (hamburger icon)
- Import Redux dispatch and `toggleMobileSidebar` action
- Hamburger menu button that only shows on mobile (`lgDown`)
- Button positioned at the left of the header
- Dispatches Redux action to open/close mobile sidebar

**Visual Change:**
```
Mobile Header Before:  [Employee Portal          🧑]
Mobile Header After:   [☰ Employee Portal        🧑]
```

### 2. **Sidebar.tsx** - Connected to Redux State
**File:** `starterkit/src/app/(EmployeeLayout)/layout/vertical/sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`

**Changed:**
- Removed local `mobileOpen` state
- Connected to Redux `customizer.isMobileSidebar` state
- Uses Redux dispatch to toggle sidebar
- Increased z-index to 1300 for proper layering
- Added padding to sidebar content

**How it works:**
- Desktop (lg and up): Permanent sidebar visible
- Mobile (below lg): Temporary drawer that slides in/out

---

### 3. **SidebarItems.tsx** - Auto-Close on Navigation
**File:** `starterkit/src/app/(EmployeeLayout)/layout/vertical/sidebar/SidebarItems.tsx`

**Added:**
- Import Redux dispatch and media query
- Auto-close sidebar after clicking menu item on mobile
- Detects if on mobile and closes drawer automatically

**User Experience:**
1. User taps hamburger menu → Sidebar opens
2. User taps "Projects" → Navigate to projects page AND sidebar closes
3. Clean, intuitive mobile experience

---

## How It Works Now

### On Desktop:
- Sidebar always visible on the left
- No hamburger menu button
- Standard desktop layout

### On Mobile:
1. **Hamburger button (☰)** visible in header
2. Tap hamburger → **Sidebar slides in from left**
3. See menu with:
   - DASHBOARD (header)
   - Overview
   - Projects
   - Reports
   - Time Tracker
4. Tap any menu item → Navigate AND sidebar closes
5. Tap outside sidebar or hamburger again → Sidebar closes

---

## Technical Implementation

### Redux State Management:
```typescript
// State in customizer slice
isMobileSidebar: boolean

// Action to toggle
toggleMobileSidebar()
```

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- **Desktop (lg+)**: >= 1200px - Permanent sidebar
- **Mobile (< lg)**: < 1200px - Drawer sidebar with hamburger

### Component Structure:
```
EmployeeLayout
├── Header (with hamburger button on mobile)
├── Sidebar (drawer on mobile, permanent on desktop)
└── Main Content
```
